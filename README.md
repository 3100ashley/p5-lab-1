# Intro to Coding with p5.js Workshop 

A one-week workshop taught at Anderson Ranch, August 2016

Explore the creative potential of networked, shareable art in this introduction to coding with p5.js—a platform for making interactive, visual experiences online. Students experiment with creating simple visuals, as well as integrating video, sound, sensors and mobile devices. Tutorials and code samples are balanced with individual reviews and time to work in the studio. This is an excellent initiation into the artistic possibilities of code.

##Schedule

###Monday - Hello world
1. __Intro__ Meet and greet, workshop overview, objectives.
2. __Drawing Instructions__ An exercise inspired by the [Conditional Design group](http://conditionaldesign.org/). Read their [manifesto](http://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/) and check out the [archive](http://conditionaldesign.org/archive/) of instructions and drawings. Check out [knots](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/knots/), [hatching](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/hatching/), and [convex city plan](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/convex-city-plan/).

  * Break into partners. As a team, devise a set of instructions to create a drawing. Write out the instructions on paper provided.
  * Switch instructions with another pair. You create a drawing based on their instructions, and they create a drawing based on yours.
  
3. __Discussion: context__
  * A few references: [Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt), [Yoko Ono](https://monoskop.org/images/2/2a/Ono_Yoko_Grapefruit_A_Book_of_Instructions_and_Drawings_by_Yoko_Ono_S_and_S_edition_excerpt.pdf) and other [instruction artists](http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/notes/essay/e002_text.html), Casey Reas Eyeo2012 talk on [Chance Operations](https://vimeo.com/45851523).
  * What is programming?
  * What is Processsing and p5.js?
  * What is happening with the browser?
  * What can you make? Some [incomplete ispiration](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/blob/master/inspiration.md).

4. __Playing around__

  * Download the [p5.js editor](http://p5js.org/download/).
  * Try adding some of the lines of code from [this list](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/blob/master/commands.md) into the places where it says `setup()` and `draw()`. Press the play button to run your code.
  * Can you figure out what each of the lines does? What is the difference between `setup()` and `draw()`?

5. __Tutorial: Basic drawing__ Download examples [here](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/blob/master/01_drawing/01_drawing.zip). More walk through examples [here](http://p5js.org/home/).

6. __Tutorial: Variables__ Download examples [here](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/blob/master/02_variables_animation/02_variables_animation.zip).

7. __Studio: Found object__ 
  * Go for a walk around the ranch and surrounding area and find an object that intrigues or inspires you.
  * Replicate it with code. It can be as realistic or abstract as you like.
  * Include one element that is different each time you load the sketch.
  * Include one element that changes as you move the mouse.
  

###Tuesday - Play it

0. __Review: Found objects__
1. Download examples [here](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/blob/master/02_variables_animation/02_variables_animation.zip).
2. __Tutorial: Logic I - if__ With a partner, make inverse programs.
2. __Tutorial: Logic II - animation__ Add an element of timing to your found object piece.
3. __Tutorial: Logic III - interactivity__ Make a sketch with two inputs (ex: a rollover button and a clickable button, or a keypress and a mouse click)
4. __Studio: Brainstorm games__
 * Concept: Using what you've learned so far, come up with a simple single player game. Try to keep the mechanic and interaction as simple as possible to start out. [Here is some inspiration](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/blob/master/inspiration.md#games).
 * Mechanics:
    * What is the goal? What does the user do?
    * How do you win or finish? (OR DO YOU)
 * Details:
    * How do you detect if the player is achieving the goal?
    * How do you communicate to the player how they are doing?
    * What are the different “states”? Are there levels? Just a playing mode vs gameover mode?
    * Is there timing involved?
    * What are the different mini problems you will need to tackle to put this together?

5. __Studio: Paper prototype games__ Find a way to create some kind of paper prototype that you can test with others, or a storyboard that you can walk through with another person. Try to represent the different elements that come into play at different event times.
6. __Tutorial: Logic III - state__
7. __Studio: Build games__
8. __Discussion: FTP__

###Wednesday - Where are you?

0. __Review: Games__
2. __Tutorial: Media__
3. __Tutorial: Geolocation__
4. __Studio: Make a location-based artwork__

###Thursday - Take it further

0. __Review: Location-based pieces__
1. __Tutorial: Functions__
2. __Studio: Final projects__ Work on final projects, individual crits and tutorial.

###Friday - Wrap it up

0. __Studio: Final projects__ Work on final projects, individual crits and tutorial.
1. __Discussion: p5 community__
2. Final review, wrap-up, next steps.
