# Intro to Coding with p5.js Workshop 

A one-week workshop taught at Anderson Ranch, August 2016

Explore the creative potential of networked, shareable art in this introduction to coding with p5.jsâ€”a platform for making interactive, visual experiences online. Students experiment with creating simple visuals, as well as integrating video, sound, sensors and mobile devices. Tutorials and code samples are balanced with individual reviews and time to work in the studio. This is an excellent initiation into the artistic possibilities of code.

##Schedule

###Monday - Hello world.
1. __Intro.__ Meet and greet, workshop overview, objectives.
2. __Drawing Instructions.__ An exercise inspired by the [Conditional Design group](http://conditionaldesign.org/). Read their [manifesto](http://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/) and check out the [archive](http://conditionaldesign.org/archive/) of instructions and drawings. Check out [knots](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/knots/), [hatching](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/hatching/), and [convex city plan](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/convex-city-plan/).

  1. Break into partners. As a team, devise a set of instructions to create a drawing. Write out the instructions on paper provided.
  2. Switch instructions with another pair. You create a drawing based on their instructions, and they create a drawing based on yours.
  
3. __Playing around.__

  1. Download the [p5.js editor](http://p5js.org/download/).
  2. Try adding some of the lines of code from [this list](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/blob/master/commands.md) into the places where it says `setup()` and `draw()`. Press the play button to run your code.
  3. Can you figure out what each of the lines does? What is the difference between `setup()` and `draw()`?

4. __Tutorial: Basic drawing.__
5. __Tutorial: Variables.__
6. __Studio: Create a self portrait.__
  

###Tuesday - Play it.
