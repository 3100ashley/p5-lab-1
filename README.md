# Intro to Coding with p5.js Workshop 

A one-week workshop taught at Anderson Ranch, August 2016

Explore the creative potential of networked, shareable art in this introduction to coding with p5.jsâ€”a platform for making interactive, visual experiences online. Students experiment with creating simple visuals, as well as integrating video, sound, sensors and mobile devices. Tutorials and code samples are balanced with individual reviews and time to work in the studio. This is an excellent initiation into the artistic possibilities of code.
